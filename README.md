# patients-no-show

# About
The objective of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of the Data Analysis Process. The main research question concerns the factors that explain patient no-shows. No-show efers to patients who fail to show up to scheduled appointments or cancel at the last minute giving the health center no opportunity to fill the appointment slot. This problem of no-shows poses considerable challenges to the effectiveness and quality of healthcare delivery.

This project is my submission to the Investigating a Dataset Project of Udacityâ€™s Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

# Dataset 
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle.com. It contains information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. It spans the period of Nov 10, 2015, to June 8, 2016.

# Summary of Findings
- No-show rate is similar among males and females which suggests that gender is not a good predictor of no-shows.
- There is a weak negative association between no-show and age which suggests that no-show is more prevalent among younger patients. 
- While we observe a difference in the prevalence of no-shows among patients with hypertension and diabetes, there is no difference in no-shows between alcoholics and non-alcoholics.
- The analysis reveals that interventions such as scholarship and sms reminders are not effective in discouraging no-shows. 
- The rate of No-shows increases as patients' waiting time increases.
- No-shows is high among patients with history of missed appointments.
- Among the variables included in this analysis, the number of past missed appointments is the strongest predictor of no-shows.
